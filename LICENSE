*A Functionally Equivalent Statement is a code fragment which, regardless of whitespace and object names, achieves the same result within the context of a discord bot. Basically you can't copy the code, rename the variables, add whitespace and say it's different. It's not.

If you see something that can be improved or a bug that I (MCE626) don't know how to fix, tell me. Submit a Pull Request! One thing: Don't steal please! An enormous amount of effort and time went into this and it's not ok for someone to take this and call it their own.
